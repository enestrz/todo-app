# Hello! This is Enes Terzi speaking!

#### I wrote that app cause I was bored and I wanted to learn some new stuff. Also, I wanted to put my CV to get hired and get a job. I'm not sure if I'm gonna get a job or not, but I'm gonna try my best.

This app builds with tears and blood and a few lines of code.

First of all, I'm gonna explain how to use this app.
### How to use it?

***First of all, you need to install Node.js and npm.***
Aaaaand I will tell you later the rest. So far let's enjoy the app.
